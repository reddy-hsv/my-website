    <h3>Register Page</h3><br>
    <p>The Register Page is designed for new users to create an account by providing details such as username, email ID, password, and contact number. It ensures proper validation so that only correct information is submitted. This page helps in maintaining student records for future login and access.</p><br>

    <h3>Login Page</h3><br>
    <p>The Login Page allows existing users to securely log in using their registered email/username and password. It ensures authentication, so only valid users can access their dashboard, course materials, or form data. For additional security, features like “Forgot Password” can also be included.</p><br>
